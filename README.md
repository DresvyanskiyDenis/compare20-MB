# Ensembling End-to-End Deep Models for Computational Paralinguistics Tasks: ComParE 2020 Mask and Breathing Sub-Challenges
ComParE 2020 Mask and Breathing Sub-Challenges

## Description
This project contains the scripts for our entry in the Mask and Breathing Sub-Challenges, which are the part of the INTERSPEECH 2020 Computational Paralinguistics Challenge (ComParE 2020).
